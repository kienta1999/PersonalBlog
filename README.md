# PersonalBlog
My personal blog website using HTML, CSS, JS (Node.js)

Make sure you have Node.js and mongoDB installed.

Step 1: Navigate to the local path that stores the project and run command "npm i" to install the needed Node.js framework (express, body-parser, ejs, and mongoose)

Step 2: Direct to the bin folder of mongoDB "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.4\bin" (replace 4.4 with your MongoDB version). Run mongod.exe (to activate the database).

Step 3: run node app.js to activate the server

Step 4: Open the blog website at http://localhost:3000/ and add/remove the blogs as you wish.
